        Each a three-time state champion, Jay Borschel and Dan LeClere have a chance in their senior year to join the sports most elite group: the "four-timers," wrestlers who win four consecutive state titles. For Jay, a ferocious competitor who feeds off criticism and doubt, a victory would mean vindication over the great mass of skeptics waiting for him to fail. For Dan, who carries on his back the burdens of his tiny farming community, the dreams of his hard-driving coach and father, and his own personal demons, another title is the only acceptable outcome.

        Four Days to Glory is the story of America as told through its small towns and their connection to sport the way it was once routinely perceived: as a means of mattering to the folks next door.',

        Each a three-time state champion, Jay Borschel and Dan LeClere have a chance in their senior year to join the sports most elite group: the "four-timers," wrestlers who win four consecutive state titles. For Jay, a ferocious competitor who feeds off criticism and doubt, a victory would mean vindication over the great mass of skeptics waiting for him to fail. For Dan, who carries on his back the burdens of his tiny farming community, the dreams of his hard-driving coach and father, and his own personal demons, another title is the only acceptable outcome.',

          In this excellent presentation from the Dan Gable "On-the-Mat" Demonstration Wrestling Clinic, wrestling icon Dan Gable demonstrates a wide variety of simple, yet devastating, pinning holds that wrestlers at any level - in any weight class - can utilize. Gable begins with a demonstration on how to break an opponent down. From there he covers more than 10 different situations your wrestlers may find themselves in, and how to execute a fall from those situations. Techniques covered include Turks, cross wrist series, power halves and more. He closes with the drills to help reinforce these useful techniques.

          "description":'Rob Koll presents a "safe" alternate to the conventional leg riding offense. When a wrestler throws in a conventional leg ride, there is a 50-50 chance that he can get bumped to his hip, giving his opponent a good chance to score an escape or reversal. With his opposite leg offense, Coach Koll shows how the inside position will keep your wrestler off his hip and in control, forcing the opponent to adjust to your wrestler instead of looking for a way out. Koll shows how to breakdown the opponent and the proper way to secure the opposite leg. Once in position, he breaks down five different ways to score back points or a fall. A two-time World Cup Champion, Koll perfected this move during his freestyle career, so he includes a Trap Arm Gut Wrench from the opposite leg that can be used in freestyle competition. Throughout his presentation Koll includes drills to help perfect the technique. Your wrestlers can execute the same moves from the conventional leg ride with the opposite leg offense, allowing them to adapt quickly to this new technique. Koll closes his presentation with a brief demonstration on the Crab Ride, showing the proper positioning for both the top and bottom position. These punishing rides will generate bonus points and wear out the opponent.',
